# COM Port Read And Write Application For Windows

## How It Works?

You can read data from com port of your pc or write data to com port with this application. Firstly you need a device that uses serial communication like arduino uno. This device must sents data to com port continously or waits your command and when gets your command sends data to com port. If you use Arduino UNO like me you can use example code(COMPortExamp.ino) in this repo. Upload this code to your Arduino and launch this application. Select currently active COM Port and set Baud Rate to 9600 because we was define baud rate 9600 in Arduino code. Now you can connect to COM Port and read data from "Received Data" panel. Clean button, removes all data from your received data panel. If you want send data to COM Port, you can input some values to "Data to be send" textbox and click "Send" button.
